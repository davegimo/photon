# Particle Photon alarm system
This is the repository for the example of usage of Particle Photon made by Daniele Pasquini in the class Pervasive Systems A.Y. 2016/2017

## Code
The code is composed by:
+ the .ino file to be flashed on the Photon ([photon.ino](https://github.com/hopelesscoder/photon/blob/master/photon.ino "photon.ino"))
+ the .html file to control the alarm ([alarm.html](https://github.com/hopelesscoder/photon/blob/master/alarm.html "alarm.html"))
+ the .php file to send an email when the alarm is activated ([sendmail.php](https://github.com/hopelesscoder/photon/blob/master/sendmail.php "sendmail.php"))
